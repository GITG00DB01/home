<h2> 1. Caustic </h2>
<p> The physco who murdered everyone in his path in the name of "science", caustic's gas traps are great at cutting off his enemys and good as a form of a deadly smoke screen to revive his teamates or kill his enemys. He is one of the two people with the Fortified attribute (10% damage reduction) making him a walking tank with the right gear </p>

<h3> 2. Octane </h3>
<p> An adrenaline junkie at heart. Octane is one of the newer addition (after he came out in season 1), he is extremely deadly with his speed. He takes a form of a stimulant that increases his speed even more but at the cost of a bit of his health but its not a problem he has to worry about because he has a supprising healing factor that no other legends have </p>

<h4> 3. Gibraltar </h3>
<p> Gibraltar is the other heavy of Apex alongside Caustic. A true defender at heart, Gibraltar has a dome sheild to protect his teammates from enemies and explosions. His teammates can even heal faster while in his dome making him a good part of any team </p>

<h5> 4. Lifeline </h5>
<p> Lifeline is the medic of the apex games, she carries a drone around with her to heal her and her teammates that she calls "D.O.C". she can use it after or even during a fire fight, making it much easier to survive those extra shots. </p>

<h6> 5. Bloodhound </5>
<p> Bloodhound is a mysterious character because we dont know anything about them, not even their gender. Their ability lets them track anyone within a (estimated) range of 30 to 40 meters all around them, even past caustic and bangalore's smoke. </p>
